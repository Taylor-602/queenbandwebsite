        <p class="historyinfo">
          Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970. The band
          comprised Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar,
          vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals) and John Deacon (bass). Their
          earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and
          heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional
          and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as
          arena rock and pop rock.
        </p>

        <p class="historyinfo">
          Before forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band
          Smile. Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment
          with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined in 1970
          and suggested the name “Queen”. Deacon was recruited in February 1971,
          before the band released their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen
          first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974.
          Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975
          brought them international success. The latter featured “Bohemian
          Rhapsody”, which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and
          helped popularise the music video format.
        </p>

        <p class="historyinfo">
          The band’s 1977 album News of the World contained “We Will Rock You”
          and “We Are the Champions”, which have become anthems at sporting
          events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock
          bands in the world. “Another One Bites the Dust” from The Game (1980)
          became their best-selling single, while their 1981 compilation album
          Greatest Hits is the best-selling album in the UK and is certified
          nine times platinum in the US. Their performance at the 1985 Live Aid
          concert is ranked among the greatest in rock history by various
          publications. In August 1986, Mercury gave his last performance with
          Queen at Knebworth, England. In 1991, he died of bronchopneumonia, a
          complication of AIDS. Deacon retired in 1997. Since 2004, May and
          Taylor have toured as “Queen +”, with vocalists Paul Rodgers and Adam
          Lambert.
